<h1>Annoying</h1>
<p>Phishing- people posing as legit companies or institutes contacting individuals by phone, email, or mail in order to receive personal information like your card number, bank account, and social security number.

Flaming- “cyber-bullying”- the act of being rude, using crude language to an individual over the internet

Spamming- sending messages over the phone, email, or also mail repeatedly

The similarities of these three is that they all can be involved with victimizing. They single someone out in order to get something that they want whether it be money or who-knows. They’re different in that spamming may not be intentionally, but instead is just something that just might happen because someone forgets to turn it off maybe. Also, with spamming, the people who are responsible for sending the mail may not be after you directly, they may- just want someone to come into their store to buy some discounted soap.</p>
